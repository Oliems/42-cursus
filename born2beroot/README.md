## Presentation

This document aims to be a walkthrough of the Born2beroot project at 42
School. It is based on the work of
[hanshazairi](https://github.com/hanshazairi/42-born2beroot) and
[HEADLIGHTER](https://github.com/HEADLIGHTER/Born2BeRoot-42). Its goal is
to unify the two aforementioned sources into one comprehensive guide for
this project.

## Installation
At the time of writing, the latest stable version of
[Debian](https://www.debian.org) is *Debian 11 Bullseye*. Watch *bonus*
installation walkthrough *(no audio)* [here](https://youtu.be/2w-2MX5QrQw).

WARNING: Do not forget to partition the disk correctly if you want to do the bonus.

After the installation you might want to [change the font and the resolution](#how-to-change-the-font-and-the-resolution-of-the-vm)
before you start configuring the VM.
## *sudo*

### Installing *sudo*
Switch to *root* and its environment via `su -`.
```
$ su -
```
Install *sudo* via `apt install sudo`.
```
$ apt install sudo
```
Verify whether *sudo* was successfully installed via `dpkg -l | grep sudo`.
```
$ dpkg -l | grep sudo
```

### Adding User to *sudo* Group
Add user to *sudo* group via `adduser <username> sudo`.
```
$ adduser <username> sudo
```
>Alternatively, add user to *sudo* group via `usermod -aG sudo <username>`.
>```
>$ usermod -aG sudo <username>
>```
Verify whether user was successfully added to *sudo* group via `getent
group sudo`.
```
$ getent group sudo
```
`reboot` for changes to take effect, then log in and verify *sudopowers*
via `sudo -v`.

### Running *root*-Privileged Commands
From here on out, run *root*-privileged commands via prefix `sudo`. For
instance:
```
$ sudo apt update
```

### Configuring *sudo*
See [this page](https://superuser.com/questions/869144/why-does-the-system-have-etc-sudoers-d-how-should-i-edit-it)
if you want to learn more about sudo and the sudoers.d folder.

Configure *sudo* via `sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/<filename>`. `<filename>` can
be whatever you want but it shall not end in `~` or contain `.`, let's name
it `config`.
```
$ sudo vi /etc/sudoers.d/config
```
Below are the options you need to change, see the [sudoers man page](https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/1.8.13/sudoers.man/)
for more information.
```
Defaults passwd_tries=3
Defaults badpass_message="<custom-error-message>"
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/<filename>"
Defaults log_input,log_output
Defaults iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo"
Defaults requiretty
Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
```

## SSH

### Installing & Configuring SSH
See the [sshd man page](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config) for more information.

Install *openssh-server* via `sudo apt install openssh-server`.
```
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
```
Configure SSH via `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
```
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
To set up SSH using Port 4242, replace below line:
```
#Port 22
```
with:
```
Port 4242
```
To disable SSH login as *root* irregardless of authentication mechanism,
replace below line
```
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```
with:
```
PermitRootLogin no
```
You need to restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:
```
$ sudo service ssh restart
```
Check SSH status via `sudo service ssh status`.
```
$ sudo service ssh status
```
>Alternatively, check SSH status via `systemctl status ssh`.
>```
>$ systemctl status ssh
>```

### Installing & Configuring UFW
Install *ufw* via `sudo apt install ufw`.
```
$ sudo apt install ufw
```
Verify whether *ufw* was successfully installed via `dpkg -l | grep ufw`.
```
$ dpkg -l | grep ufw
```
Enable Firewall via `sudo ufw enable`.
```
$ sudo ufw enable
```
Allow incoming connections using Port 4242 via `sudo ufw allow 4242`.
```
$ sudo ufw allow 4242
```
Check UFW status via `sudo ufw status`.
```
$ sudo ufw status
```

### Connecting to Server via SSH

**WARNING**: In order to connect to the server you need to configure
port forwarding in the VM settings.

+ Right click on the VM and go to "Settings".
+ Go to the "Network" tab, click on "Advanced" then on "Port Forwarding".
+ Fill in like in the image below.

![Port Forwarding](/img/port-forwarding.png)

You can now connect to your VM using:
```
ssh username@127.0.0.1 -p 4242
```
You can check the IP address of your VM using `ip addr`
Terminate SSH session at any time via the `logout` or using Ctrl-D.
```
$ logout
```
>Alternatively, terminate SSH session via `exit`.
>```
>$ exit
>```

## User Management

### Setting Up a Strong Password Policy

See the [login.defs man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/login.defs.5.html)
as well as the [passwd man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/passwd.1.html).
#### Password Age
Configure password age policy via `sudo vi /etc/login.defs`.
```
$ sudo vi /etc/login.defs
```
To set password to expire every 30 days, replace below line
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
```
with:
```add
PASS_MAX_DAYS   30
```
To set minimum number of days between password changes to 2 days, replace
below line
```
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
```
with:
```
PASS_MIN_DAYS   2
```
To send user a warning message 7 days *(defaults to 7 anyway)* before
password expiry, keep below line as is.
```
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
```
**WARNING:** The changes made to this file applay only to new users. If you
have already created a user with you username and do not which to create a
new one to apply changes made to login.defs you can run
`chage -m 2 -M 30 -W 7 <username>`.

#### Password Strength
Secondly, to set up policies in relation to password strength, install the
*libpam-pwquality* package. See the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_pwquality)
for more informations.
```
$ sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```
Configure password strength policy via `sudo vi
/etc/pam.d/common-password`, specifically the line containing:
```
pam_pwquality.so retry=3
```
To set password minimum length to 10 characters, add below option to the
above line.
```
minlen=10
```
To require password to contain at least an uppercase character and a
numeric character:
```
ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1
```
To set a maximum of 3 consecutive identical characters:
```
maxrepeat=3
```
To reject the password if it contains `<username>` in some form:
```
reject_username
```
**Note:** The subject states that: "The following rule does not apply to
the root password: The password must have at least 7 characters that are
not part of the former password." From this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70945482)
and [the man page](https://man.archlinux.org/man/pam_pwquality.8.en#enforce_for_root) we get that
this just means that since the root user is not asked for the old password so the check
which compare the old and the new password are not performed.

To set the number of changes required in the new password from the old
password to 7:
```
difok=7
```
To implement the same policy on *root*:
```
enforce_for_root
```
Finally, it should look like the below:
```
password	requisite	pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root
```
### Changing the passwords

After this step you need to change your user password as well as the root password
so that they conform with the new password policy. You can use the `passwd <username>`
command to do that.

### Creating a New User
Create new user via `sudo adduser <username>`.
```
$ sudo adduser <username>
```
Verify whether user was successfully created via `getent passwd
<username>`.
```
$ getent passwd <username>
```
Verify newly-created user's password expiry information via `sudo chage -l
<username>`.
```
$ sudo chage -l <username>
Last password change								: <last-password-change-date>
Password expires									: <last-password-change-date + PASS_MAX_DAYS>
Password inactive									: never
Account expires										: never
Minimum number of days between password change		: <PASS_MIN_DAYS>
Maximum number of days between password change		: <PASS_MAX_DAYS>
Number of days of warning before password expires	: <PASS_WARN_AGE>
```

### Creating a New Group
Create new *user42* group via `sudo addgroup user42`.
```
$ sudo addgroup user42
```
Add user to *user42* group via `sudo adduser <username> user42`.
```
$ sudo adduser <username> user42
```
>Alternatively, add user to *user42* group via `sudo usermod -aG user42
><username>`.
>```
>$ sudo usermod -aG user42 <username>
>```
Verify whether user was successfully added to *user42* group via `getent
group user42`.
```
$ getent group user42
```

## *cron*

### Setting Up a *cron* Job
See the [crontab man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) for more information.
Configure *cron* as *root* via `sudo crontab -u root -e`.
```
$ sudo crontab -u root -e
```
To schedule a shell script to run every 10 minutes, replace below line
```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
```
with:
```
*/10 * * * * sh /path/to/script
```
Check *root*'s scheduled *cron* jobs via `sudo crontab -u root -l`.
```
$ sudo crontab -u root -l
```

## Q&A - Preparing for the defense

This section gives you an overview of what you need to know for the defense.

### Why Debian?
See:
+ https://www.debian.org/
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian

I chose Debian because it is easier to install and configure than CentOS,
and because I was already familiar with Debian.

### What is a virtual machine?
See:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine

In computing, a virtual machine is the virtualization/emulation of a
computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and
provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may
involve specialized hardware or software. It allows the user to run several
operating systems on the same host, each VM being separated both from the
host and from other VMs.

### What is cron and what is wall?

+ Cron: Linux task manager that allows us to execute commands at a certain
  time. We can automate some tasks just by telling cron what command we
  want to run at a specific time. For example, if we want to restart our
  server every day at 4:00 am, instead of having to wake up at that time,
  cron will do it for us.

+ Wall: command used by the root user to send a message to all users
  currently connected to the server. If the system administrator wants to
  alert about a major server change that could cause users to log out, the
  root user could alert them with wall.

### What is the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
See:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)

From the Wikipedia page:

LVM is used for the following purposes:

+ Creating single logical volumes of multiple physical volumes or entire
  hard disks (somewhat similar to RAID 0, but more similar to JBOD),
  allowing for dynamic volume resizing.

+ Managing large hard disk farms by allowing disks to be added and replaced
  without downtime or service disruption, in combination with hot swapping.

+ **On small systems (like a desktop), instead of having to estimate at
  installation time how big a partition might need to be, LVM allows
  filesystems to be easily resized as needed.**

+ Performing consistent backups by taking snapshots of the logical volumes.

+ Encrypting multiple physical partitions with one password.

**LVM can be considered as a thin software layer on top of the hard disks and
partitions, which creates an abstraction of continuity and ease-of-use for
managing hard drive replacement, repartitioning and backup.**

### Why a VM?
VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power
needs, to run software that requires a different operating system, or to
test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.

### How does a VM works?
See:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor

Virtual machines relies on virtualization e.g software used to simulate
virtual hardware that allows VMs to run on a single host machine.

### What is difference between apt and aptitude?
See:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude_(software)

APT is a collection of tools distributed in a package named apt. A
significant part of APT is defined in a C++ library of functions; APT also
includes command-line programs for dealing with packages, which use the
library. Three such programs are *apt, apt-get and apt-cache*.

Basically apt is a package manager, a piece of software used to manage the
installation of programs, while aptitude is a frontend for apt which aims
to make it easier to use by providing a user interface based on ncurses.

### What is AppArmor and SELinux
See:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux

These two programs are modules for the Linux kernel which aims to improve
the security of the system.

### What is SSH?
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell

SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) is a network protocol that gives users,
particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer
remotely over an unsecured network.

### How to change the font and the resolution of the VM

**Resolution**
See:
+ https://superuser.com/a/1034711

A straightforward way of achieving that would be to change the specific
configuration in the grub2 bootloader directly:

1. Find out the resolutions supported by your debian guest

+ Reboot debian and keep pressing `c` until you see the grub console.
+ Type `vbeinfo` and hit enter. It will give you a list of supported resolutions.

2. Edit /etc/grub.d/00_header

+ Replace the following line
```
if [ "x${GRUB_GFXMODE}" = "x" ] ; then GRUB_GFXMODE=auto ; fi
```
with the new resolution. e.g.:
```
if [ "x${GRUB_GFXMODE}" = "x" ] ; then GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080 ; fi
```
Right underneath, make a copy of the line edited and replace MODE with PAYLOAD. e.g.:
```
if [ "x${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD}" = "x" ] ; then GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD=1920x1080 ; fi
```
Further below, you'll find the following line:
```
set gfxmode=${GRUB_GFXMODE}
```
Add the following line below it:
```
set gfxpayload=${GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD}
```
Reload grub2 configurations by running the command `update-grub2` and then run `reboot`.

[Note]
I've seen many examples in which the default line `#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480` in
the file /etc/default/grub in uncommented. It was proven to be unnecessary
for me but in case you need it, remember to update-grub2 after you've
uncommented it.

**Font**

See:
  + https://askubuntu.com/a/173221

Just run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup`.
I suggest you pick TerminusBold in size 12 or 14 as you font.

**Scale factor**

Even after you have changed the font and the resolution, you might also
want to increase the scale factor in the VM settings.
+ In VirtualBox right click on your VM and go to "Settings".
+ Go to the "Display" tab and increase scale factor to something like 200%.

### How to create a new user?

```
$ sudo adduser username				# creating new user (yes (no))
$ sudo chage -l username			# Verify password expire info for new user
$ sudo adduser username sudo		# assign new user to the sudo group
$ sudo adduser username user42		# assign new user to the user42 group
```

### What to check?

```
$ lsblk									#  1) Check partitions
$ getent group sudo						#  3) sudo group users
$ sudo aa-status						#  2) AppArmor status
$ getent group user42					#  4) user42 group users
$ sudo service ssh status				#  5) ssh status, yep
$ sudo ufw status						#  6) ufw status
$ ssh username@ipadress -p 4242			#  7) connect to VM from your host (physical) machine via SSH
$ vi /etc/sudoers.d/<filename>			#  8) yes, sudo config file. You can $ ls /etc/sudoers.d first
$ vi /etc/login.defs					#  9) password expire policy
$ vi /etc/pam.d/common-password			# 10) password policy
$ sudo crontab -l						# 11) cron schedule
```

#### How to change hostname?
```
$ sudo vi /etc/hostname
```
